# RelationDatabaseModel

This project was assigned to me as a student at Franciscan University (UFN). We were tasked with creating a brief summary of the relational database model (RDM) and its significance within database management systems (DBMS).

The project includes both a PT-BR (Brazilian Portuguese) and a Standard American English version. It builds on prior work and has direct relation to the previously submitted GitHub repository, serving as an expansion of the foundational knowledge already established.

The summary covers the core principles of the relational model, including the structure of relations (tables), the importance of keys and constraints, and how the relational model underpins many modern database systems. Additionally, it examines the role of the relational model in ensuring data consistency, integrity, and efficient query execution.

The formatting standard for both versions follows ABNT (Associação Brasileira de Normas Técnicas), the official Brazilian academic formatting norm. While this is not a formal research paper, the standard was used for consistency and practice.
